+ [Dynamic Scheduling of Network Updates](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~xinjin/files/SIGCOMM14_Dionysus.pdf) 
+ [TIME4: Time for SDN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.03421.pdf)



## valuable papers 
+ [Software-defined networking: A comprehensive survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.0440.pdf)
+ [A Survey on Software-Defined Network and OpenFlow: From Concept to Implementation](http://www.hit.bme.hu/~jakab/edu/litr/SDN/OpenFlow_Survey_06819788.pdf)
### this papers use time for cordinating netwrok events and timed updates
+ [TIME4: Time for SDN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.03421.pdf)

### following papers should be studied
+ [Achieving High Utilization with Software-Driven WAN](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2013/08/Achieving-High-Utilization-with-Software-Driven-WAN.pdf)
+ [B4: Experience with a Globally-Deployed Software Defined WAN](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/41761.pdf)<br/>
according to "related work" section in "TIME4: Time for SDN",SWAN suggests reserving unsed scratch capacity of 10-30% on every link results to fewer packet loss.
B4 reduced bandwidth for some or all of flows during update
