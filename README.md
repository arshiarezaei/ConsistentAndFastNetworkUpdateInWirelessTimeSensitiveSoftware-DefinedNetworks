### this papers use time for cordinating netwrok events and timed updates
+ [TIME4: Time for SDN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.03421.pdf)

### following papers should be studied
+ [Achieving High Utilization with Software-Driven WAN](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2013/08/Achieving-High-Utilization-with-Software-Driven-WAN.pdf)
+ [B4: Experience with a Globally-Deployed Software Defined WAN](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/41761.pdf)<br/>
according to "related work" section in "TIME4: Time for SDN",SWAN suggests reserving unsed scratch capacity of 10-30% on every link results to fewer packet loss.
B4 reduced bandwidth for some or all of flows during update
